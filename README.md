This package implements a few polynomial basis types, and convenience methods for evaluation and derivatives, fast batched evaluation, for building small and fast ML type models. Layers currently implemented include: 
* Various orthogonal polynomials via 3-point recursion
* Trigonometric polynomials 
* Complex and real spherical and solid harmonics 
* A few quantum chemistry (atomic orbitals) basis sets 
* Utilities to recombine them into (tensor) product or compressed basis sets 

We also aim to provide full `Lux.jl` integration. A possible application of this might be to implement various flavours of equivariant neural networks and related models.
